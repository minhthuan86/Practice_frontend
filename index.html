    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
      Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now. On her
      desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and
      all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well
      thumbed copy of <cite>On the Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favoritee
      book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more
      shr felt she needed to be free
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spent the last ten years in this room sitting under a poster with
      an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that
      <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better todo</q>. Although
      may consider her pineering work, unraveling the ssecrets of the llama
      <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding
      achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
